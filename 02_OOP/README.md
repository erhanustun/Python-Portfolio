# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into **objects** — self-contained units that combine **data (attributes)** and **behavior (methods)**.

## Key OOP Principles
- **Encapsulation** → Grouping data and methods inside classes, protecting internal state.  
- **Inheritance** → Reusing and extending functionality from existing classes.  
- **Polymorphism** → Using a single interface with different underlying data types.  
- **Abstraction** → Hiding unnecessary details and exposing only relevant functionality.

### `bank_account.py`
- Demonstrates **encapsulation** and **dunder methods** (`__str__`, `__eq__`).  
- Example operations: deposit, withdraw, balance check.  

### `shapes_inheritance.py`
- Implements **inheritance** with `Shape`, `Circle`, and `Rectangle`.  
- Shows **method overriding** and **polymorphism**.  

### `employee_manager.py`
